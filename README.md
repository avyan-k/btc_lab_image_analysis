## Usage

For some of the code to run (namely stain normalization), a virtual environment with an older version of python is required (python 3.10.5). 

Please activate a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -n torch-staintools-env python=3.10.5
```

```bash
conda activate torch-staintools-env
```

You will now be able so install the right packages to run all files

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
