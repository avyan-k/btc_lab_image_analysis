# Usage

For some of the code to run (namely stain normalization), a virtual environment with an older version of python is required (python 3.10.5). Please activate a conda environment:
```
conda create -c conda-forge -n torch-staintools-env python=3.10.5
```
```
conda activate torch-staintools-env
```
You will now be able so install the right packages to run all files
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
